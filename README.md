This project was one of our activity in Data Structures and Algorithim.

The main focus of this activity is the exclusive use of array in storing the data for the game, Only arrays is used as a challenge by our professor.

The Flow of the Game.
1. Toss Coin - To determine who goes first and the order in which players take card from one another.
2.  Card shuffling - This is where the cards are shuffled before giving them to each and every player, each player gets 17 cards each.
3.  Hide 1 Card - This is the card that gets hidden and also the card that will signify if which of the player will be the loser aka the mooonkey.
4.  Pairing of cards - At this stage where players have 17 cards on their hand, they will pair all the duplicates card they have until all the remaining cards don't have a pair. All the paired cards will be discarded.
5.  Stealing of cards - This is the main cycle of the game, based on the order of the players the first player takes one card from the 2nd player and if that card matches a pair within their current hand it can be discarded. then player 2 takes from player 3 then 3 from 1,
6.  Last card on hand - If there is only 2 players left and the last player that holds the singular card is the monkey (loser).
